</div>

<p>The Work here presented to the Reader is
a Copy, with a small Variation noticed
hereafter, as to the Cuts, and a Translation, as to
the Letter Press, of one well known to the Curious
by the Title of <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>, or
<i>The Images of Death</i>; which is reported to be in
reality indebted for its Existence to an Event that
<span class="smcap">Boccace</span> did but feign as the Occasion of writing
his <i>Decameron</i>; I mean the Calamity of a
Plague: And its History is as follows.</p>

<p>Pope <span class="smcap">Eugenius IV.</span> having summoned a
Council to meet at the City of Basle, or, as
it is more usually called, Basil, in Switzerland;
it accordingly met there in the Year
1431, and continued to sit for Seventeen
Years, Nine Months, and Twenty-Seven Days,
or, according to Mr. <span class="smcap">Walpole</span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, but Fifteen
Years in the whole; and at this Council the
Pope himself, and after his Death his Successor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span>
<span class="smcap">Felix V. Sigismond</span> Emperor of Germany,
<span class="smcap">Albert II.</span> then King of the Romans, and
many other Princes and Persons of distinguished
Rank were present. During the Sitting of this
Council, viz. in the Year 1439, the City of
Basil was visited with a Plague, which raged for
some Time with extreme Violence, and carried
off many of the Nobility, and several Cardinals
and Prelates who attended that Council, some of
whom were interred in the very Cemetery where
the Painting, of which we are about to speak,
now is; and, on the Cessation of the Distemper,
the surviving Members of the Council, with a
View to perpetuate the Memory of this Event,
and of their providential Deliverance from its
Effects, caused to be painted in Oil on the Walls
of the Cemetery, near the Convent of the Dominicans,
a <i>Dance of Death</i>, representing all
Ranks of Persons, from the Pope to the Peasant,
as individually seized by Death; adding
also to each Figure eight Lines in German,
four of them containing an Address from Death
to them severally, the other four their Reply.
The Name of the Painter employed on this Occasion
has not been transmitted down to us with
Certainty; but some Persons have imagined that
this Painting was the Work of <span class="smcap">Hans Holbein</span>:
Whether it were done by him or another, shall
be hereafter considered; but, in the mean Time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span>
we shall here proceed to relate the subsequent
History of the Painting itself.</p>

<p>It is, however, to be observed, that <span class="smcap">Matthew
Merian</span>, who, in 1649, published in German,
at Franckfort, in small Quarto, a Book entitled
<span class="smcap">Todten Tanz</span>, or <i>Death’s Dance</i>, containing
Engravings from the above-mentioned Painting<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
and from the Preface to whose Work, as translated
into French, in an Edition printed at Basil in
1744, most of the foregoing Facts are extracted,
does not speak in positive Terms as to the precise
Time when the original Figures were painted,
but only says, that they are believed, and with
great Probability, to be of that Time in which
he had placed them; in further Confirmation of
which he has noticed, that <span class="smcap">Sigismond</span> was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
himself a Lover and extraordinary Patron of the
Arts, and had always about him a Number of
Artists; and that <span class="smcap">John ab Eyck</span>, the Inventor
of Oil Painting, flourished in his Reign; but Mr.
<span class="smcap">Warton</span><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has related (though it does not appear
on what Authority) not only that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>
was the Painter, but that the Subject in Question
was painted in 1543; in which I conceive
him misinformed: For <span class="smcap">Merian</span> was, as he himself
tells us, a Native of Basil, and possibly
might have had his Account by Tradition; and,
had the Painting been of no earlier a Date than
1543, it is hardly probable (considering too that
it is in Oil) that it should have been so much injured
by Time as to stand in Need, as we find
it did, of an almost total Repair in 1568: To all
which I add, that <span class="smcap">Merian</span> seems so well satisfied
of the Truth of his Account, that he tells
us further that the Figures were drawn from
Nature, and are dressed each in the Habit of the
Time; and that those of the Pope, Emperor,
and King, are respectively Portraits of <span class="smcap">Felix V.</span>
who succeeded <span class="smcap">Eugenius IV.</span>, <span class="smcap">Sigismond</span> Emperor
of Germany, and <span class="smcap">Albert II.</span>, King of the
Romans; all of whom, as we have before remarked,
were present at the Council.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Walpole</span><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> mentions that this Painting
was repaired in 1529; but in this he seems
to have been misled (accidentally taking one Date
instead of another) by a Passage in the Preface to
<span class="smcap">Merian</span>’s Book before cited. <span class="smcap">Merian</span> informs
us, that the Painting in Question having
been much injured by Time, <span class="smcap">John Hugh Klauber</span>,
a Painter, and Citizen of Basil, was, in
1568, employed to repair it; and that, finding
a Vacancy on the Wall sufficient for his Purpose,
he added at the Head of the Painting a Portrait
of <span class="smcap">Johannes Oecolompadius</span>, in Memory
of the Reformation in 1529, to which his
preaching the Gospel to all Ranks, as he did,
might be supposed in some small Degree to contribute;
and, at the End of the Painting, on
another Part of the Wall, he added the Portraits
of himself, his Wife, and his Children: And
this Repair by <span class="smcap">Klauber</span>, <span class="smcap">Merian</span> tells us further,
was commemorated in a Latin Tablet, which
in his Time hung near the Painting. Some
Time after, it was again repaired, and so, without
any further Repair, it continued till <span class="smcap">Merian</span>’s
Time; but <span class="smcap">Keysler</span>, who visited it in 1729,
in his <i>Travels</i>, Vol. I. P. 171, Edit. 8vo. 1760,
relates, that the original Colours were then totally
effaced, that only the Outlines of the Figures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
were left, and that it had then been lately
repaired.</p>

<p>The Thought of this allegorical Representation
of Death, though in the present Instance immediately
suggested by the Event above related, was
not in itself original, but borrowed in some
Measure from a Kind of Masquerade, which Mr.
<span class="smcap">Warton</span><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> observes was anciently celebrated in
the Churches abroad, particularly those of France
(and, among others, it seems to have been performed
in St. Innocent’s Church at Paris) and
in which all Ranks and Degrees of Persons were
personated by the Ecclesiastics of those Churches,
who all danced together, and then disappeared;
and it is certain that before the Calamity above-mentioned
happened at Basil, and consequently
before this Painting there was begun, Allusions
to a <i>Dance of Death</i> occurred in the Writings of
the Authors of the Time, in Reference, no Doubt,
to that Kind of Masquerade. It were needless
to introduce a Number of Quotations to support
this Assertion; but as some Proof may, perhaps,
be expected, I here insert from <i>The Vision of</i>
<span class="smcap">Piers Plowman</span>, written about 1350, the following
Passage, with which Mr. <span class="smcap">Warton</span>’s
<i>Hist. of Poetry</i>, Vol. II. P. 54, has furnished me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Death came driving after, and all to Dust pash’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kings and Cæsars, Knights and Popes.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And I further find that, several Years prior to
the Breaking out of this Plague at Basil, the Idea
had even been carried into Execution; for that
in 1384, a <i>Death’s Dance</i> had been painted at
Minden, in Westphalia<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>: But, no sooner had
this Painting at Basil been finished, and become,
as it very soon after did, universally celebrated
all over Europe, but the <i>Dance of Death</i> became
a very favourite Subject, and was frequently
painted in public Buildings. The earliest Instance
which has yet occurred, subsequent to the
Painting at Basil, is one which Mr. <span class="smcap">Warton</span><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
mentions at Lubec, in the Portico of St. Mary’s
Church, painted in 1463; and of which Dr.
<span class="smcap">Nugent</span>, in his <i>Travels</i>, Vol. I. P. 102, speaking
of Lubec, gives the following Account:</p>

<p>“But the most noted Thing in St. Mary’s
Church is the Painting called <i>Death’s Dance</i>, so
much talked of in all Parts of Germany. It
was originally drawn in 1463, but the Figures
were repaired at different Times, as in 1588,
1642, and last of all in 1701. Here you see the
Representation of Death leading an Emperor
in his imperial Robes, who with his other Hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
takes hold of such another Figure, which leads
up a King; and so alternately a Figure of
Death and a human Person through all Conditions
and Stages of Life. The Intention of the
Artist was to shew that Death pays no Regard to
Age or Condition, which is more particularly
expressed in the Verses underneath. They were
composed at first in Plat Deutch, or Low Dutch;
but at the last Repair, in 1701, it was thought
proper to change them for German Verses,
which were written by <span class="smcap">Nathaniel Schlott</span>,
of Dantzick.” Of these Verses Dr. <span class="smcap">Nugent</span> has
inserted a Translation from the original German,
by a Lady of Dantzick, from which it appears
that the Originals consist of, first, an
Apostrophe of Death to all, and then an Address
of Death to one Individual; then follows his
Reply; after that, Death’s Address to another;
next, his Reply; and so on. It further appears
from the Translation, that the Characters delineated
in the Painting are the following: The
Pope, Emperor, Empress, Cardinal, King, Bishop,
General, Abbé, Knight, Carthusian, Burgomaster,
Prebendary, Nobleman, Physician, Usurer, Chaplain,
Steward, Church-Warden, Tradesman, Recluse,
Peasant, Young Man, Maiden, Infant,
Dancing-Master, and Fencing-Master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>In Addition to this Instance we learn, that, in
the Reign of Henry the Sixth, one <span class="smcap">Jenken
Carpenter</span> caused to be painted at his Expence
on the Walls of the Cloister of St. Paul’s
Cathedral, London<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, the <i>Dance of <span class="smcap">Machabray</span></i>,
or <i>Dance of Death</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>; and it is more than probable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
that the celebrated Painting of the same
Kind in St. Innocent’s Church, in Paris, in like
Manner owes its Original to the Painting at Basil.</p>

<p>Nor are these the only Instances in which this
Subject has been chosen for the Decoration of
Buildings; for in 1525 it was painted at Annaberg,
and in 1534, in the Castle or Palace at
Dresden; as it also was, though when is unknown,
at Leipsic and other Places<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>The same Inclination in Favour of this Subject
began also, very soon after the Painting in
Question was known, to discover itself in literary
Publications, and in the Decorations and
Ornaments of Books. One <span class="smcap">Macaber</span>, a
French or German Poet, but of what Æra is
uncertain, wrote in German a Poem on the
Subject of <i>Death’s Dance</i>, which, in Consequence
of this Circumstance, is not seldom
from him called <i>The Dance of <span class="smcap">Macaber</span></i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
His Verses were translated into French, and
written round the Cloister of St. Innocent’s, at
Paris, under, as I conceive, the before-mentioned
Painting; and from this French Translation,
<span class="smcap">Lydgate</span>, at the Request of the Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul’s<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, made a Version, which
was afterwards inscribed on the Walls of their
Church, under the Painting of the same Subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>It would be an endless Task, and afford but
little Entertainment to the Reader, to reckon
up here a long List of Books in which the Subject
has been reiterated: We shall therefore content
ourselves with mentioning that it appeared
in the Chronicle of <span class="smcap">Hartmannus Schedelius</span>,
printed at Nuremberg in 1493, Folio<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, usually
called the Nuremberg Chronicle; in the Quotidian
Offices of the Church, printed at Paris, 1515,
in 8vo<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>; in several Horæ, Missals, &amp;c. and even
so late as in <i>A Book of Christian Prayers, collected
out of the ancient Writers and best learned
of our Time</i>, first printed in 4to. 1569, and afterwards
in the same Size in 1608; and that, in
Addition to all these and others which might be
mentioned, the Painting at Basil was the Cause
of the Publication of the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>,
from which the present is copied and translated,
and of which therefore it will be necessary here
to give an Account; first observing, that the Excellence
of the Cuts in the Original, which are
here also copied with sufficient Fidelity, has induced
an Opinion that they were the Work of
<span class="smcap">Holbein</span>, a Fact which we mean hereafter to
inquire into.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Papillon</span>, in his <i>Traité historique et pratique
de la Gravure en Bois</i>, 8vo. 1766, Tom. I. P. 166,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
informs us, that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>, having arrived to a
great Degree of Perfection in Painting, was employed
by a Magistrate of Basil to paint a <i>Dance
of Death</i> in the Fish-Market of that City, near
a Cemetery (by which he undoubtedly means
the Painting at Basil, of which we have so often
had Occasion to speak); that this Work added
much to his Reputation; after which he employed
his Skill in reducing the original Figures
into a small Size; and that he afterwards engraved
them upon Wood, with a Delicacy and
Beauty not to be equalled. But unfortunately
<span class="smcap">Papillon</span> here speaks without sufficient Attention;
for the Painting at Basil, as may be learnt
from <span class="smcap">Merian</span>’s Engravings before mentioned,
and on the Accuracy of which I am assured by
an ingenious Friend, who lately examined them
with the Originals, I may rely, consists of single
Figures, each led by a Figure of Death, and following
each other in order, so as to form a long
Procession: The same may be remarked of the
Painting at St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span>’s; and, for aught that appears
to the contrary, of that at Lubec, and of
that at St. Innocent’s Church at Paris, and probably
of all the others which we have noticed
above: Whereas the present Cuts consist of separate
Compartments, each containing Groupes of
Figures, so that the present Work is by no means
merely a Reduction in Size of the Painting at
Basil, but is rather to be considered as founded on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
the same Idea, and suggested by the Original, than
as a Copy from it.</p>

<p>The earliest Edition of the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>
which I have as yet seen, is one printed, as
appears from the Colophon at the End, by <span class="smcap">Melchior</span>
and <span class="smcap">Gaspar Trechsel</span>, in small 4to.
at Lyons, in 1538: It is in French, and its Title
is as follows: “<i>Les Simulachres &amp; Historiees
faces de la Mort, autant elegamment pourtraictes,
que artificiellement imaginees: A Lyons, soulz l’Escu
de Cologne.</i>” But <span class="smcap">Papillon</span>, <i>in Loco supra cit</i>,
tells us, that the Cuts to the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>
must have been done about the Year 1530, for that
the four first of them occur among <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s
Cuts to the Old Testament, printed in 1539;
and that it is apparent from those among the
Scripture Cuts, that the Blocks had then already
furnished many Thousands of Impressions. That
the four first Cuts of the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>
are among the Scripture Cuts of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>, is
certainly true; but I think I once saw, in the
Hands of a Friend, a Copy of the vulgate Latin
Bible, in which those Scripture Cuts were inserted,
and which, if my Memory does not
greatly deceive me, was printed so early as in
or about 1518 or 1520.</p>

<p>The same Author further relates, that the first
Edition, which he thinks for the above Reasons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
should be placed in the Year 1530, was printed
at Basil, or Zuric, with a Title to each Cut,
and, as he believes, some Verses under each, all
in the German Language (but, that there was an
early Edition in Flemish); and adds, that the
Book, having passed over into France, was much
sought after by the Curious there; so that a Printer
of Lyons was induced to purchase the Blocks,
and that from them he printed several Editions in
Latin, French, and Italian.</p>

<p>Having thus accounted for the Existence of
the Book, and for its Arrival in France, it
remains to speak of the several Impressions
which it there underwent. We have already
mentioned one, the earliest which we know of,
printed in small Quarto, at Lyons, <i>soulz l’Escu
de Cologne</i>, by <span class="smcap">Melchior</span> and <span class="smcap">Gaspar Trechsel</span>,
in 1538: The Cuts in this Edition are
forty-three in Number, and no more; and
over each is, in Latin, a Passage from either the
Old or New Testament or Apocrypha, which, in
the present Publication, is given in English, from
the Translation of the Bible now in use. Under
the Cuts are four Lines in French Verse, the
Substance of which has been preserved in all the
Editions, whether they were in Latin, French,
or Italian. This Edition, in order to make it
of a tolerable Size (for the Cuts alone would have
been too few to constitute a Volume) is accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
with several Tracts in French, which, as
not relating to, or connected with, our present Subject,
we here forbear to enumerate; but it is necessary,
before we close our Account of this Edition
of 1538, to remark, that it is preceded by a Dedication
in French, to the very Reverend Abbess of
the Religious Convent of St. <span class="smcap">Peter</span> of Lyons, Madam
<span class="smcap">Jehanne de Touszele</span>; and in this Dedication
the Author of it notices, that the Name
and Surname (or, as we term them, the Christian
and Surname) of the Abbess and himself are
precisely the same in sound, excepting only the
Letter T, from which I conjecture (for his Name
does not any where appear) that his Name was
<span class="smcap">Jean</span>, or, as it was anciently written, <span class="smcap">Jehan</span>
[<i>i. e.</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>] <span class="smcap">de Ouszell</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ozell</span>, as
it is now usually spelt. In this Dedication is
also a Passage, a Translation of which will be
given hereafter, from which it appears that the
Person by whom the Cuts were designed, was
then dead, leaving behind him several others of
the same Kind, which, though drawn, were
unfinished, and particularly one representing a
Waggoner crushed under his overthrown Waggon;
in which Cut, a Figure of Death is represented
secretly sucking through a Reed, the
Wine out of a Cask; and that to these unfinished
Cuts no one had dared to put the last Hand.</p>

<p>The next Edition, in Point of Time, which I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
have seen, I conceive to have been the first that
appeared in Latin, and it was printed in Duodecimo,
at Lyons, <i>sub scuto Coloniensi</i>, by <span class="smcap">John</span>
and <span class="smcap">Francis Frellon</span>, in 1542. It contains
the same Number of Cuts (and no more) as that
of 1538, and is entitled, “<i>Imagines de Morte, et
Epigrammata e Gallico idiomate a Georgio Æmylio
in Latinum translata</i>;” from whence it appears
that it is, in Fact, a Translation of the French
Edition of 1538. This also contains some additional
Tracts, all differing from those in the
Edition of 1538, but not in the least relating to
the present Inquiry, and therefore not here particularized,
though they have been continued
through almost all the subsequent Impressions,
and have been given respectively in French, Latin,
and Italian, according as the Verses under
the Cuts to the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span> were in one
or other of those Languages.</p>

<p>In 1547, another Edition was published of
this Book, in French; it was entitled, “<i>Les
Images de la Mort</i>,” and printed at Lyons, <i>A
l’Escu de Cologne, Chez <span class="smcap">Jehan Frellon</span></i>; the
Title-Page also informs us that twelve Cuts are
added to it, and on Examination we find that the
Cuts inserted in Page 40, and the seven subsequent
Pages of this Work, and four Cuts of
Boys, which, as not relating to this Subject, are in
the present Edition omitted (none of which occur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
in either the French Edition of 1538, or the Latin
one of 1542, the only two prior Editions that
I know of) are to be found in this of 1547<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>In the same Year, viz. 1547, but whether prior
or subsequent to the last above mentioned, cannot
be known, another Latin Edition appeared,
printed at Lyons by the same <span class="smcap">John Frellon</span>,
and containing the same increased Number of
Cuts as the French one of the same Year, that
is to say, fifty-three in all; and the same <span class="smcap">John
Frellon</span>, in 1549, printed an Edition of this
Work in Italian and Latin, the Passages from
Scripture over the Cuts being in Latin, and the
Verses under the Cuts in Italian; and this also
contains the same Number of Cuts with the
two last-mentioned Editions: But <span class="smcap">Papillon</span>,
P. 169, remarks that the Blocks, when this Edition
of 1549 was printed, had already furnished
more than an hundred-thousand Impressions, for
that in some Places they appear to be worn.</p>

<p>In 1562, the same <span class="smcap">John Frellon</span> published
another French Edition, which appears, by the
Printer’s Colophon at the End, to have been
printed at Lyons by <span class="smcap">Symphorien Barbier</span>,
and which professes in the Title to be augmented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
with seventeen Plates. <span class="smcap">Papillon</span>, P. 182,
mentions both this Edition and Peculiarity, but
denies the Truth of the Assertion, because he
tells us, that in this French Edition he finds but
five more Cuts than in the Italian One of 1549;
notwithstanding which, it is certainly true, as
will be presently proved. <span class="smcap">Papillon</span> admits
that the Edition of 1562 contains five Cuts more
than that of 1549, and, if he had gone farther
back in his Research, would have found that
that of 1549 (and so do the French and Latin
Editions of 1547) comprizes twelve more than
that of 1538, and that those twelve were first
added to the French and Latin Editions of 1547.
The Edition of 1562 does not assert that that
contains seventeen Cuts more than any preceding
Edition, but, reckoning the five which
it has more than the Impression of 1549, and
the twelve which that has more than the Edition
of 1538, and which are also inserted in that of
1562, they make together seventeen Cuts more than
were in the Edition of 1538, and consequently
justify the Assertion in the Title, that the Edition
of 1562 contains seventeen additional Cuts.</p>

<p>The Success which such a Number of Editions
seems to imply, induced a Bookseller of
Cologne to counterfeit the Book; and, instead of
making use of the original Cuts, which, in all
Probability he could not procure, he got Copies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
and not very exact ones, engraven from them
for his intended Edition. When the first counterfeited
Edition appeared, I am not informed;
but am induced to think that this Person, whom
I have above described as a Bookseller of Cologne,
was <span class="smcap">Arnold Birckman</span>, as I find an
Edition, printed in 1555, at Cologne, <i>Apud hœredes</i>
<span class="smcap">Arnoldi Birckmanni</span>. In this Edition,
and also in one printed by the same Persons in
1573, the Cuts are reversed, the Passages from
Scripture over the Cuts, and also the Verses under
the Cuts, are in Latin; and both these Editions
contain the Number of Cuts in the Latin and
French ones of 1547, and no more: In the Cut
inserted P. 17, of the present Edition, is the following
Mark <img class="inline" src="images/letter-sa.jpg" width="50" height="36" alt="SA" /> (intended, no doubt, for that
of the Engraver) and which was that of <span class="smcap">Silvius
Antonianus</span>, an Artist of considerable Merit.</p>

<p>Having thus given the History of this celebrated
Work, we are now to inquire, in the first
Place, whether the original Painting at Basil
were, or not, painted by <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>; and, in the
second, whether the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span> were
either designed or engraven by him.</p>

<p>As to the first of these Questions it is to be
observed, that <span class="smcap">Merian</span>, whom we have above
mentioned, has related that this Picture at Basil
was painted during the sitting of the Council<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
before mentioned, which met in 1431, and sat
either fifteen, according to some, or something
more than seventeen Years, according to other
Authors; so that the Painting now under Consideration
must have been done between the
Years 1439, when the Plague broke out, and
1446, or 1448, when the Council broke up; now
it is certain that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> was not born till
1498<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>: nor do we find that he was ever employed
on the Painting at Basil, even so much as to retouch
it. <span class="smcap">Hugh Klauber</span>, who repaired it in
1568, is recorded, and it is not probable that, if
it ever had been touched upon by <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>,
that Fact should, in his own native City, have
been passed over in Silence: On the contrary,
it is more likely that an Opportunity should have
been rather sought to reveal it<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p>From these Considerations it appears pretty
evidently, that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> has no Claim to the
Painting at Basil: We now proceed, therefore,
to the second Inquiry, viz. Whether he either
designed or engraved the original Cuts to the
<span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>, and here it may first be
necessary to state what Reasons there may be for
supposing them his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas Borbonius</span>, a Poet contemporary
with <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>, has addressed to him an Epigram
“<i>De Morte picta, a Hanso Pictore nobili</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>,”
from which it is inferred that he painted a <i>Dance
of Death</i>; and <span class="smcap">Sandrart</span> relates that in the
Year 1627, in a Conversation with <span class="smcap">Rubens</span>, at
which he was present, the <span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>
was stiled <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s, as will appear from the
following Passage, translated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Warton</span>
from <span class="smcap">Joach. Sandrart</span>, <i>Academ. Pict.</i> Part II.
Lib. iii. Cap. 7. P. 241, “I also well remember
that in the Year 1627, when <span class="smcap">Paul Rubens</span>
came to Utrecht to visit <span class="smcap">Handorst</span>, being
escorted both coming from, and returning to
Amsterdam, by several Artists; as we were in
the Boat, the Conversation fell upon <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s
Book of Cuts representing the <i>Dance
of Death</i>, that <span class="smcap">Rubens</span> gave them the highest
Encomiums, advising me, who was then a
young Man, to set the highest Value upon
them; informing me, at the same Time, that
he, in his Youth, had copied them.” <span class="smcap">Warton</span>’s
<i>Observations on <span class="smcap">Spenser</span></i>, first Edit. P.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span>
231, in a Note, where is also inserted a Translation
from the same Work, P. 238, in the following
Words, “But, in the Fish-Market there”
[at Basil] “may be seen his” [<span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s]
“admirable <i>Dance of Peasants</i>, where also, in
the same public Manner, is shewn his <i>Dance
of Death</i>; where, by a Variety of Figures, it is
demonstrated that Death spares neither Popes,
Emperors, Princes, &amp;c. as may be seen in his
most elegant wooden Cuts of the same Work.”</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Bullart</span>’s <i>Academie des Sciences</i>, Tom. II.
P. 412, is a Passage, of which the following is a
Translation: “Nevertheless, he” [<span class="smcap">Holbein</span>]
“has not sent any Thing into the World which is
not painted with the last Degree of Perfection.
The Inhabitants of Basil have an excellent Witness
of this in their Town-House: It is his Piece
of the <i>Dance of Death</i>, which he has reduced
into Colours, after having engraven them
very neatly on Wood; and which appeared so
excellent to the learned <span class="smcap">Erasmus</span>, that,
after having published his Praises, he invited
<span class="smcap">Holbein</span> to draw his Picture, in order that
he might have the Happiness of being represented
by so skilful a Hand.”</p>

<p>Mons. <span class="smcap">Patin</span>, in the Catalogue of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s
Works, prefixed to his Edition of <span class="smcap">Erasmus</span>’s
<i>Praise of Folly</i>, in Latin, closes his List<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
with Words to the following Effect, “He also
engraved several Things upon Wood, among
which are his <i>Scripture Cuts</i>, and <i>Dance of
Death</i>, vulgarly called <i>Toden Tans</i>; from which
that Picture is not very different, which was
painted from the Life by the Hand, as some
think, of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> himself, and is enclosed
by wooden Pallisadoes from Strangers in the
Cemetery of the Predicants, in the Suburbs of
St. <span class="smcap">John</span>, at Basil:” And <span class="smcap">Prior</span> takes it for
so acknowledged a Fact that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> painted
the well-known <i>Dance of Death</i>, that, in his
<i>Ode to the Memory of Colonel <span class="smcap">George Villiers</span></i>,
he thus alludes to it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In vain we think that free-will’d Man has Pow’r</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hasten or protract th’ appointed Hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our Term of Life depends not on our Deed;</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By “great <span class="smcap">Henry</span>’s Tombs,” <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the Seventh’s
Chapel in Westminster-Abbey is meant.</p>

<p>To refute by minute Examination the several
Errors in the above Citations, would be an almost
endless Task; it is sufficient here to remark, that
the Passage from <span class="smcap">Borbonius</span> is too general to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
ascertain, whether he means a <i>Dance of Death</i>, or
a single Figure; that <span class="smcap">Sandrart</span> or <span class="smcap">Rubens</span>’s
Declaration is too far distant from the Time, to
be of any great Weight; as is also <span class="smcap">Patin</span>’s Assertion,
that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> actually engraved the
<span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>: And surely, if it had been
either designed or engraven by him, <span class="smcap">Frellon</span>,
for whom so many Editions were printed, would
not have failed to have mentioned it in some of
them, when we find, that in the Editions of the
<i>Scripture Cuts</i>, which he printed, he has inserted
a Latin Poem of some Length, and also a Greek
Epigram, both by <span class="smcap">Borbonius</span>, with a Translation
of this latter into Latin, all to prove, that
the Cuts were the Work of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>. It is
further to be observed (as one Reason for ascribing
these Cuts to <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>) that a Cut of the
<span class="smcap">Imagines Mortis</span>, which occurs P. 36 of this
Edition, but the Mark is there purposely omitted,
has to it in the original the Letters H L thus
conjoined <img class="inline" src="images/letter-hl.jpg" width="50" height="36" alt="HL" /> which <span class="smcap">Papillon</span> asserts, is one
of the Marks of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>; and <span class="smcap">Christian
de Mechel</span>, Engraver to the Elector Palatine,
seems so well convinced of their being really at least
designed by <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>, that he has inserted the
<i>Dance of Death</i>, as represented in the <span class="smcap">Imagines
Mortis</span>, among the rest of his Works, which
he is now publishing; but the Number of Cuts
there given, is no more than Forty-Six.</p>

<p>It were much to be wished that <span class="smcap">Mechel</span> had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
informed us, from what he had copied the <i>Dance
of Death</i>; whether, as he probably did, from
Drawings; and, if so, where those Drawings
were to be found, and on what further Evidence
he had ventured to ascribe them to <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>;
for, as will presently appear, there is very great
Reason, at least, for doubting the Fact, notwithstanding
that the four first Cuts of the <span class="smcap">Imagines
Mortis</span> occur among the Cuts to the Old Testament,
printed in 1539, and which we are told
expressly in a Poem, and also in an Epigram, of
<span class="smcap">Borbonius</span>, prefixed to them, are of the Hand
of <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>; but whether by this we are to
understand, that he designed or engraved them,
or both, we are left to seek. After having thus
ventured to question in general Terms, <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>’s
Title to the Merit of this Work, it is
incumbent on me to shew on what my Doubts
are founded, and this I am prepared to do; for,
in the Dedication to the Edition of the <span class="smcap">Imagines
Mortis</span>, in 1538, is a Passage, of which
I here insert a faithful Translation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To return then to our <i>Cuts of Death</i>, we
now very justly regret the Death of him
who has here designed such elegant Figures,
exceeding as much all the Examples hitherto,
as the Paintings of <span class="smcap">Apelles</span>, or of <span class="smcap">Zeuxis</span>,
exceed the Moderns. For his sorrowful Histories,
with their Descriptions severely verified,
excite such Admiration in the Beholders,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
that they think the Figures of Death appear
as if quite alive, and the Living as if dead.
Which makes me think that Death, fearing
that this excellent Painter would paint him so
much alive, that he should no longer be feared
as Death, and that, for this Reason, he himself
would become immortal; for this very
Cause hastened so much his Days, that he
could not finish several other Cuts already by
him traced, and among others that of the
Waggoner overthrown and bruised under his
overturned Waggon; the Wheels and Horses
of which are there represented so frightfully,
that as much Horror is occasioned to view
their Downfall, as Delight to contemplate the
Liquorishness of one Figure of Death, who is
secretly sucking through a Reed the Wine
from the emptied Cask: To which imperfect
Histories, as well as to the inimitable Rainbow,
no one has dared to put the last Hand.”</p>

</div>

<p>This Dedication is prefixed to the Edition of
1538, and speaks of the Designer (by which, I
conceive, we must understand both Painter and
Engraver, for it speaks of the Drawings of the
unfinished ones as having been then already
traced or drawn; and, if so, they might surely
have been finished by the Engraver of the former
ones) as then lately dead; now it is well known
that <span class="smcap">Holbein</span> did not die till 1554<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
it could not be he: And I would further observe,
that the Mark <img class="inline" src="images/letter-hl.jpg" width="50" height="36" alt="HL" /> is not peculiar to <span class="smcap">Holbein</span>.
<span class="smcap">Strutt</span>, in his <i>Biographical Dictionary
of Engravers</i>, Vol. II. P. 86, attributes it to
one <span class="smcap">Hans Lederer</span>, of whom he gives no
Particulars; and the <i>Catalogue of Marks and Cyphers
of Engravers</i>, P. 21. Edit. 1730, mentions
one <span class="smcap">Lambrecht Hopfer</span>, a German, but the
Age in which he lived is not noticed, who
used, as his Mark, sometimes a Vase of Flowers
in the Midst of the Letters L H, and sometimes
the perpendicular Stroke of the L in the second
Stroke of the H, which is exactly as it appears
in the Cut before referred to.</p>

<p>I have only to add, that the Cuts in the present
Edition, excepting only the first (which,
representing in the Original the Deity in the
Habit of the Pope, to avoid giving Offence, it was
thought proper to omit, and to substitute in its
Room one designed for the Purpose) are engraven,
and the Verses under them translated,
from the Latin Edition of 1547; and that the additional
Cuts, which appeared in the French Edition
of 1562 (with the Omission only of four of
Boys, as being foreign to this Subject) are here
also inserted, and the Verses under them translated
from the French.</p>

P. 230, in a Note, says, that <span class="smcap">Macaber</span> wrote a Description in
Verse of a Procession, painted on the Walls of St. Innocent’s
Cloister, at Paris, called the <i>Dance of Death</i>; so that in this
Passage Mr. <span class="smcap">Warton</span> must be supposed to understand that
<span class="smcap">Macaber</span>’s Verses were written posterior to that Painting.
He further informs us, in the Additions and Corrections to the
second Volume of his <i>History of Poetry</i>, that the earliest complete
French Translation of these Verses was printed in 1499,
but that a less perfect Edition had been before published in
1486, and that the French Rhymes in this last are said to be
by <span class="smcap">Michel Marot</span>. A Copy in French of <i>La grande
Danse de <span class="smcap">Macabre</span> des Hommes et des Femmes</i>, printed in
4to. at Troyes, for <span class="smcap">John Garnier</span>, but without a Date, I
have seen; and find from the Verses under each Cut, that the

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
